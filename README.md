# Beer Styles
The world of beer today is big and often intimidating. This style guide aims to help people gain some basic knowledge about both fundamental and trendy beer styles. There are already plenty of style guides targeting home-brewers and craft beer enthusiasts, the target users for this website are primarily those who want a quick and easy way to learn the basics of beer in order to gain some confidence when ordering that Imperial New England Style IPA or Irish Dry Stout. 

The information displayed strives to have intuitive navigation and be easily digestible through layout and style. The idea is that users will be able to return to the site and quickly find information about specific beer styles that they might be curious about. The ultimate goal of the website is to further an inclusive and welcoming culture so that more people get a chance to discover the wonderful diversity of beer.


## Features


## Testing
Fixed issues:  
There was a visual problem with the columns in the style section. When a box in a column was highlighted the other columns would shift vertically. See screenshot:

My assumption was that this was caused by a float/clear issue cuasing positions to overlap somehow. I fixed this by replacing the float property with a display:flex property and centering the content.
